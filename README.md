# Color Detection
Building an application through which one can get the name of the color by clicking on them automatically.
For this purpose, we have a dataset that contains the color names and its values.
We will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.


# Color Dataset
Red, Blue and Green constitute the three primary colors. In computers, all the color values are defined within a range from 0 to 255. 
There are approximately around 16.5 million ways to represent a color.
We will need to map all the values to their corresponding names. We will be using a dataset that
contains the RGB values with their corresponding values.
